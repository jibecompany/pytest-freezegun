### Fixed
- Work with pre-release pytest versions, by [chandlernine](https://github.com/chandlernine), with a different implementation proposed by [Aly Sivji](https://github.com/alysivji).
- Marking a test with `freeze_time` should freeze time in fixtures, even if the `freezer` fixture is also used explicitly late in the fixture list. Thanks to [Christian Grossm√ºller](https://github.com/chgad) for pointing out the problem.

- Registering the `freeze_time` mark, thanks to [Dima Tisnek](https://github.com/dimaqq), [Craig Anderson](https://github.com/craiga) and [Richard Terry](https://github.com/radiac). This was in really high demand.
